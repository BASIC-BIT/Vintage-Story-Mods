- **Config**: `TpaRequireTemporalGear: true`
- **Status**: Unresolved

### Bug #5: Language Text Display in Floating Bubbles
- **Source**: ModDB Comments (Ragolution, March 2025)
- **Issue**: Floating text bubbles show original language instead of spoken language
- **Example**: Player types in Tradeband, bubble shows English

- **Status**: Workaround available, root cause unresolved

## ðŸŸ  Medium Priority Bugs (Feature Issues)

### Bug #7: Sign Language Line of Sight Not Working
- **Source**: GitHub Issue #8
- **Issue**: Sign language does not adhere to line of sight requirements
- **Impact**: Core sign language feature not working as designed
- **Status**: Open bug

### Bug #8: Sign Language Using Spoken Languages
- **Source**: GitHub Issue #9
- **Issue**: Languages like Common/Tradeband used in sign language mode
- **Impact**: Sign language system behavior inconsistency
- **Expected**: Sign language should be separate from spoken languages
- **Status**: Open bug

## Additional Issues Requiring Investigation

### Inconsistent Nametag Behavior
- **Source**: ModDB Comments (Amarillo, March 2025)
- **Issue**: "Hide name tag unless targeting" works inconsistently

- **Issue**: Can't use `/say` or `/yell` commands
- **Likely Cause**: Mod compatibility or config regeneration needed
- **Status**: Needs investigation

## Bug Resolution Priority

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Connection Crash** - Critical stability issue affecting all users
2. **Server Console Crash** - Prevents admin functionality
3. **OnPlayerChat Exception** - Core chat system failure

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **TPA Gear Consumption** - Game balance issue
2. **Language Display Bug** - Core feature malfunction
3. **Nickname Format Problems** - Mod compatibility issues

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Sign Language Issues** - Complete feature implementation
2. **Nametag Inconsistencies** - Polish existing features

## Testing Requirements

### Connection Crash Testing
- Multiple simultaneous connections
- Network interruption scenarios
- Extended gameplay sessions
- Various server configurations

### TPA System Testing
- Verify temporal gear consumption
- Test cooldown mechanisms
- Validate permission requirements

### Language System Testing
- Test all language combinations
- Verify floating bubble text accuracy
- Test sign language line of sight

## Development Notes

### Network Issues Pattern
Multiple bugs relate to network timing and connection handling:
- Connection crash (packets before channel ready)
- Server console crash (null reference in network context)
- Chat system crashes (network-related null references)

**Recommendation**: Comprehensive network handling audit needed.

### Nickname System Complexity
Multiple nickname-related bugs suggest system needs overhaul:
- Display format issues
- Nametag inconsistencies
- Mod compatibility problems

**Recommendation**: Consider nickname system redesign for reliability.

### Language System Polish
Sign language implementation appears incomplete:
- Line of sight not working
- Spoken language interference
- Display inconsistencies

**Recommendation**: Complete sign language feature implementation.
