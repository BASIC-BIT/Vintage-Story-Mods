# Progress: The BASICs Mod Development Status

## What Works (Completed Features)

### âœ… Core Proximity Chat System
- **Distance-based messaging**: Messages only reach players within configurable ranges
- **Chat modes**: Whisper (5 blocks), Normal (35 blocks), Yell (90 blocks)
- **Message obfuscation**: Text becomes garbled at distance edges
- **Font size scaling**: Text size decreases with distance for visual feedback
- **Chat channel integration**: Seamless integration with Vintage Story's chat system

### âœ… Nickname System
- **Character names**: Players can set roleplay nicknames separate from usernames
- **Color support**: Customizable nickname colors with hex codes
- **Admin controls**: Administrators can manage other players' nicknames
- **Nametag integration**: Nicknames appear in player nametags above heads
- **Context-aware display**: Nicknames used in roleplay, usernames in OOC

### âœ… Language System
- **Configurable languages**: Server admins define available languages with syllables
- **Language learning**: Players can learn/forget languages with limits
- **Message scrambling**: Unknown languages appear as scrambled syllables
- **Language switching**: Players can speak in different languages with prefixes
- **Default language**: Automatic fallback to player's primary language
- **Hidden languages**: Admin-only languages for special purposes

### âœ… Sign Language Support
- **Visual communication**: Hand gesture-based communication system
- **Line of sight**: Requires visual contact between players
- **Unique formatting**: Italicized text with single quotes for distinction
- **Limited range**: Shorter range than spoken communication

### âœ… Out-of-Character (OOC) Chat
- **Local OOC**: `(message)` for nearby out-of-character communication
- **Global OOC**: `((message))` for server-wide out-of-character chat
- **Toggle system**: Players can enable/disable OOC mode
- **Color coding**: Different colors for OOC vs roleplay messages

### âœ… Player Statistics System
- **Death tracking**: Records player deaths with causes
- **Kill statistics**: Tracks both player kills and NPC/mob kills
- **Block breaking**: Counts blocks broken by players
- **Distance traveled**: Measures total distance moved by players
- **Admin commands**: View and clear statistics for any player
- **Configurable tracking**: Each stat type can be enabled/disabled

### âœ… TPA (Teleportation) System
- **Request-based teleportation**: Players request to teleport to others
- **Bidirectional**: Both "tpa" (go to player) and "tpahere" (bring player)
- **Accept/deny workflow**: Target players must approve teleportation
- **Cooldown system**: Configurable delays between teleport requests
- **Temporal gear requirement**: Optional consumption of temporal gears
- **Permission-based**: Configurable privilege requirements

### âœ… Server Quality of Life Features
- **Save notifications**: Alerts players when server save begins/ends
- **Sleep coordination**: Notifies when enough players are sleeping
- **Repair commands**: Admin tools for item durability management

### âœ… Client-Server Synchronization
- **Configuration sync**: Server config automatically sent to clients
- **Network channels**: Efficient protobuf-based communication
- **Client readiness**: Clients signal when ready to receive data
- **Channel persistence**: Remembers last selected chat channel

### âœ… Extensive Configuration System
- **Feature toggles**: Every major feature can be enabled/disabled
- **Distance customization**: All chat ranges are configurable
- **Message formatting**: Customizable verbs, punctuation, and quotation marks
- **Permission controls**: Granular privilege requirements for commands
- **Language definitions**: Complete language system configuration

## What's Left to Build

### ðŸ”„ Potential Enhancements
- **True line-of-sight**: Currently uses simple distance; could implement raycasting
- **Voice volume visualization**: Visual indicators for chat volume levels
- **Message history**: Persistent chat logs for players
- **Emote animations**: Integration with player animations for emotes
- **Language proficiency**: Gradual language learning with skill levels

### ðŸ”„ Code Quality Improvements
- **Configuration decomposition**: Break down large `ModConfig` class
- **Error handling enhancement**: More robust error recovery and user feedback
- **Performance optimization**: Further optimize message processing pipeline
- **Test coverage expansion**: Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests

### ðŸ”„ Documentation Enhancements
- **API documentation**: Comprehensive developer documentation
- **Configuration guide**: Detailed server admin configuration guide
- **Troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Migration guide**: Upgrading between mod versions

## Current Status Assessment

### Stability: âœ… Production Ready
- **Live server usage**: Successfully deployed on multiple roleplay servers
- **Version 5.1.0-rc.1**: Stable release candidate with proven reliability
- **Backward compatibility**: Player data preserved across updates
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when issues occur

### Performance: âœ… Optimized
- **Efficient algorithms**: Manhattan distance for proximity calculations
- **Minimal server impact**: Suitable for servers with large player counts
- **Network efficiency**: Protobuf serialization minimizes bandwidth usage
- **Memory management**: No known memory leaks in long-running servers

### Feature Completeness: âœ… Comprehensive
- **All core features**: Proximity chat, nicknames, languages, stats, TPA
- **Admin tools**: Complete administrative control and management
- **User commands**: Intuitive command set for all player interactions
- **Configuration**: Extensive customization options for server admins

### Code Quality: âœ… Good with Room for Improvement
- **Clear architecture**: Well-organized modular design
- **Design patterns**: Consistent use of transformers, extensions, and configuration
- **Maintainability**: Code is readable and well-structured
- **Technical debt**: Some areas could benefit from refactoring

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- **Complex configuration**: Large config file can be overwhelming for new admins
- **Client patch dependency**: Harmony patches may break with game updates
- **Limited error messages**: Some configuration errors could be more descriptive

### No Critical Issues
- All major functionality works as designed
- No game-breaking bugs or performance problems
- Stable in production environments

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Early Decisions (Still Valid)
- **Transformer pattern**: Chosen for flexibility, proven successful
- **Extension methods**: Clean API design, widely adopted in codebase
- **Protobuf serialization**: Efficient network communication, working well
- **Modular architecture**: Independent feature toggles, highly valued by admins

### Evolved Approaches
- **Configuration management**: Started simple, grew complex, may need decomposition
- **Client integration**: Initially minimal, expanded to include UI modifications
- **Language system**: Added complexity with hidden languages and proficiency limits
- **Network protocol**: Expanded from simple config sync to comprehensive messaging

### Future Considerations
- **Microservice approach**: Could split large systems into smaller, focused modules
- **Plugin architecture**: Allow third-party extensions to the mod
- **Database integration**: For larger servers, consider external data storage
- **API standardization**: Provide stable API for other mods to integrate with
