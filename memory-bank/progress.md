- **Chat channel integration**: Seamless integration with Vintage Story's chat system

### âœ… Nickname System
- **Character names**: Players can set roleplay nicknames separate from usernames
- **Color support**: Customizable nickname colors with hex codes
- **Admin controls**: Administrators can manage other players' nicknames
- **Nametag integration**: Nicknames appear in player nametags above heads
- **Context-aware display**: Nicknames used in roleplay, usernames in OOC

### âœ… Language System
- **Configurable languages**: Server admins define available languages with syllables
- **Language learning**: Players can learn/forget languages with limits
- **Message scrambling**: Unknown languages appear as scrambled syllables
- **Language switching**: Players can speak in different languages with prefixes
- **Default language**: Automatic fallback to player's primary language
- **Hidden languages**: Admin-only languages for special purposes

### âœ… Sign Language Support
- **Visual communication**: Hand gesture-based communication system
- **Line of sight**: Requires visual contact between players
- **Unique formatting**: Italicized text with single quotes for distinction

- **Protobuf serialization**: Efficient network communication, working well
- **Modular architecture**: Independent feature toggles, highly valued by admins

### Evolved Approaches
- **Configuration management**: Started simple, grew complex, may need decomposition
- **Client integration**: Initially minimal, expanded to include UI modifications
- **Language system**: Added complexity with hidden languages and proficiency limits
- **Network protocol**: Expanded from simple config sync to comprehensive messaging

### Planned Improvements

#### Network Utility Refactoring
- **SafeClientNetworkChannel**: Extract safe packet sending logic into reusable utility class
- **Location**: `Utilities/Network/SafeClientNetworkChannel.cs`
- **Benefits**: Code reuse, maintainability, consistent network handling across project
- **API Design**: Generic wrapper for any `IClientNetworkChannel` with configurable retry parameters

#### Code Quality Enhancements
- **Network Robustness**: Apply safe packet sending pattern to other mod systems
- **Utility Expansion**: Create more reusable utilities for common mod development patterns
- **Testing Framework**: Add unit tests for network utilities and retry mechanisms
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive developer documentation for network utilities

### Future Considerations
- **Microservice approach**: Could split large systems into smaller, focused modules
- **Plugin architecture**: Allow third-party extensions to the mod
- **Database integration**: For larger servers, consider external data storage
- **API standardization**: Provide stable API for other mods to integrate with
- **Network Utility Library**: Expand safe networking into comprehensive utility library
