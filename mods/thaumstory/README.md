# Thaumstory

*(real name pending, sorry dude who made that other thaum-inspired VS mod)*

Adds magic!  The current mod is a proof of concept at most.  It contains wands with modular cap, core, and pummel materials, and a projectile spell with pretty particle effects.  Oh, and a block to hold those wands in a pretty way.

## Potential Ideas

* More than anything else, I want this to not feel like a gaudy magic mod.  VS is not the place for a thaumcraft-clone, at least in my opinion.  I want to take existing mechanics and some clever programming to integrate some active use of magic outside of gears and teleporters
* Magic trees!
  * Go through some process to "infuse" a sapling and grow it into a magical tree.
  * I kinda want that process to start in a pot, maybe a special pot, and then be transferred into the ground so it can grow as a real tree.  Once it's in the ground though, you can't move it.
* Aura effects!
  * Those trees once they grow can have special area effects, such as healing, light, heating,
